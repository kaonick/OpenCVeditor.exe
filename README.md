# OpenCVeditor.exe
Easy to use opencv development tools, you can complete image processing by clicking and dragging.

It is still a very simple prototype. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to ask through the issues. I will try to improve.

I only have one person, so...hey... need patience.
